# Django Authentication Lab

In this lab, we focused on understanding and implementing Django authentication features. Below is a summary of what we covered and achieved during this lab:

## Summary:

### 1. Understanding Django Authentication:
   - Explored the basics of Django authentication system.
   - Learned about the concepts of login, logout, and registration.
   
### 2. Implementation of Authentication Views:
   - Implemented views for user login, logout, and registration using Django's built-in authentication system.
   - Utilized Django's authentication-related functions such as `login`, `logout`, and `authenticate`.

### 3. Template Integration:
   - Integrated authentication-related templates such as login, logout, and registration forms into the project.
   - Implemented HTML forms for user interaction using Django template language.
   
### 4. Views and URL Mapping:
   - Defined views for handling authentication requests and rendering corresponding templates.
   - Mapped URLs to these views to ensure proper routing of user requests.

## Files and Directories:
   - **`user_login.html`**: Template for user login form.
   - **`user_registration.html`**: Template for user registration form.
   - **`views.py`**: Contains view functions for handling authentication requests.
   - **`urls.py`**: URL patterns for mapping authentication-related URLs to views.

## How to Use:
   - Run the Django project.
   - Access the login, logout, and registration pages through the corresponding URLs.
   - Interact with the forms to perform authentication actions such as logging in, logging out, and registering a new user.

## Additional Notes:
   - Ensure that Django's authentication system is properly configured in the project settings.
   - Customize templates and views as per project requirements.
   - Implement additional features such as password reset and user profile management if needed.
